Welcome to my GitHub repository of all things code related. The best part of my job is the ability to do it anywhere and anytime. No, it's not some gimmick or work-from-home-and-get-rich scheme, but real work developing software, analyzing data, designing soutions, and hoping that at the end of the day, all of it makes the world a better place. 

Please share your ideas and in the meantime, check out the latest book I co-authorred, titled [Microsoft Azure, 2nd Edition. Managing the Intelligent Cloud](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484259573?target="_blank"). We developed and collected a lot of material for this book in order to extend beyond its physical covers and to keep pace with updates by creating a [dedicated GitHub repo for the book](https://harris-soh-copeland-puca.github.io).
